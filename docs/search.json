    "text": "The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) is a national peer-led consortium that aims to ensure the UK retains its place as a centre for world-leading research. We do this by investigating the factors that contribute to robust research, promoting training activities, and disseminating best practice. We also work collaboratively with various external stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts across the sector.\nWe seek to understand the factors that contribute to poor research reproducibility and replicability, and develop approaches to counter these, in order to improve the trustworthiness and quality of research. These issues affect all disciplines, so we aim for broad disciplinary representation. We believe that ongoing efforts to address these issues represent an opportunity to improve our research by reforming culture and practice.\nUKRN is coordinated by a Steering Group and supported by an Advisory Board, with representation across the UK through researcher-led local networks at several institutions, many of which have formally joined UKRN.\n\nRecent News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemo Quarto Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-05-17\n\n\nLisa DeBruine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nOlder newsâ€¦"
