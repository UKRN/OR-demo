This project will develop, pilot and roll out a survey of open research practices across consortium institutions, and individual- and institution-level reporting tools; collect case studies that capture examples of effective practice across a diverse range of institutions and disciplines (Years 3-5); measure indicators of training uptake and impact (Year 4-5); and share survey results, case studies, tools and frameworks across the consortium and wider sector, and incorporate these results into institutional review processes (Years 4-5).
