This project will curate existing training materials from partners plus UKRN short topical animations, briefings, more detailed primers and train-the-trainer workshop materials; identify gaps and effective practice in current provision (Year 1); train consortium trainers, and develop new training material where gaps have been identified (from Year 1); roll out training workshops (both pre-existing and new provision) across consortium members, with iterative development (Year 3-4); publish with permissive licenses the UKRN collection of training material, and disseminate to the sector (ongoing, complete by Year 5).
